Purpose:
This To-Do List web application is designed to help users effectively manage their tasks and stay organized. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as tracking their completion status.

Technologies Used:
HTML: The foundation of the application, structuring the content and layout.
CSS: Used to style the elements, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handles the dynamic functionality, including task creation, deletion, editing, and completion tracking.

Key Features:
Task Creation: Users can easily add new tasks by entering their details into a form.
Task Editing: Existing tasks can be modified to update their content or priority.
Task Deletion: Completed or unnecessary tasks can be removed from the list.

How It Works:
User Interface: The application presents a list of tasks, each with a description, completion status, and potential priority indicators.
Task Creation: Users click a "Add Task" button, enter the task details, and submit the form. The new task is then added to the list.
Task Editing: Users can click on a task to edit its details. The edited task is updated in real-time.
Task Deletion: Users can remove tasks by clicking a "Delete" button associated with each task.

Future Enhancements:
Task Sorting: Implement sorting options to organize tasks by priority, due date, or other criteria.
Task Reminders: Add features to set reminders for specific tasks.
Persistent Storage: Utilize local storage or a database to save task data, allowing users to retain their lists between sessions.
Integration with Other Tools: Explore the possibility of integrating with productivity tools like calendars or email.
This To-Do List application offers a basic framework for managing tasks. By leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a user-friendly and functional solution for staying organized.
